# Recruitment Hell
Looking for a job is terrible by itself, but a whole other level of terribleness is added by low quality emails and questions. Add in recruiters who don't really care about what they are doing and just want to move fast without understanding or proofreading anything.

In my job search I've come across a lot of very bad job descriptions, incredibly weird questions on applications, and very odd interactions with recruiters of all kinds. I've been documenting these with screenshots as I come across them, so I thought I might as well share them here.

I do want to clarify that not every recruiter, job application, or assessment is terrible. There are quite a few **great** recruiters I have worked with who genuinely care and want to find the perfect role for me. Most job descriptions are clear and well written. Many technical assessments or other tests are presented well and assess real-world skills. However, obviously none of these are funny or strange, thus they do not appear below.
